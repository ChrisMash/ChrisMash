### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm primarily an iOS developer, which has been my focus since 2012.

* Connect with me on [LinkedIn](http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/chris-mash/2b/b8/600), though I don't use it much!
* Check out my blog posts on [Medium](https://chris-mash.medium.com) (for free, of course!), though I don't blog much!
* Check out my [website](http://chrisjmash.wix.com/home), though it's probably not very up to date!
